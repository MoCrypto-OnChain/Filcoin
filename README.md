# Bridge X + People Trust: Decentralized Identity & Education Infrastructure

This repository contains the grant proposal for a community-driven, Filecoin-powered ecosystem being developed by **Bridge X Capital.AI Corp.** and **People Trust Community**. Our project combines decentralized identity, educational certification, and DeFi integration for underserved communities.

## ðŸ“„ Proposal Overview

We are requesting funding from the Filecoin DevGrants program to support the development of:

- **VeriBridge**: A decentralized identity layer using Filecoin/IPFS to store encrypted credentials, compliance documents, and access keys.
- **Bridge X Crypto Academy**: A tokenized education platform with certification storage and progress tracking on Filecoin.
- **People Trust DeFi Platform**: A stablecoin-powered lending and savings solution with identity-linked trust scores stored on Filecoin.

All components are being developed as **open-source**, public-goods infrastructure with high impact potential across marginalized and underbanked populations.
